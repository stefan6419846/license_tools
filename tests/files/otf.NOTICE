using the approach taken from https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/blob/d4df57fecf5567298f0c749d362c461649b22269/Tests/cffLib/cffLib_test.py#L66-L71

The actual code snippet used for the conversion:

```python
from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont

font = TTFont(recalcBBoxes=False, recalcTimestamp=False)
font.importXML("TestOTF.ttx")
cff = font["CFF "].cff
with open("otf.cff", mode="wb") as fd:
    cff.compile(fd, otFont=font)
```
